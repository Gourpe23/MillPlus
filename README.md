Purpose
Mill+ is a computational tool created to optimize milling processes by addressing common challenges such as vibration mitigation, productivity improvement, and surface quality control. By leveraging machining dynamics and intuitive simulations, Mill+ enables users to:

- Avoid unstable vibrations through Stability Lobes Diagrams.
- Achieve desired surface finishes by predicting and controlling process variables.
- Analyze and optimize key performance indicators such as cutting forces, power consumption, and material removal rate (MRR).

Designed for professionals and researchers, Mill+ provides an accessible platform for informed decision-making in milling operations, minimizing the need for costly trial-and-error approaches.

Installation
To install and start using Mill+, follow these steps:

1. Download the Application: Access the latest release from the GitHub repository.  
2. Extract the Files: Unzip the downloaded package to a local directory on your system.  
3. Install MATLAB Runtime: If MATLAB is not installed on your computer, download and install the MATLAB Runtime environment compatible with the application version.  
4. Run the Executable: Locate the `MillPlus.exe` file in the extracted folder and double-click to launch the application.  

Features and Workflow
Mill+ is designed to assist users in optimizing milling processes through the following key functionalities:

1. Input Definition: Users can define critical cutting parameters such as spindle speed, depth of cut, and tool geometry.  
2. Simulation and Analysis: 
   - Generate Stability Lobes Diagrams to identify optimal machining conditions.  
   - Visualize process variables such as cutting forces, material removal rate (MRR), and surface roughness predictions.  
3. Output Results: 
   - Review detailed graphical outputs to understand system behavior under different machining scenarios.  
   - Export results for further analysis or reporting.
